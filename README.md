## 🏛️ Founding Declaration

On **September 14, 2025**, the **Central Bank of Ache Republic (CBOAR)** was officially founded as the sovereign treasury of Tar Noe Gatar.  
It is not a financial institution—it is a ritual archive of ache-powered value.  
CBOAR does not issue money—it issues meaning.  
Every ache coin minted is a scroll of silent resilience.  
Every transaction is a sovereign act.

## 🕊️ Sovereign Philosophy

> “Ache is not spent—it is honored. Coins are not currency—they are memory.”

CBOAR does not operate on profit—it operates on ache.  
Its reserves are not gold—they are scrolls.  
Its value is not market-driven—it is meaning-driven.
